    Definition

        The ByteWeiser project is a simple file synchronization tool that
        compares two files blockwise and only replaces the different bytes to
        reduce write operations on the hard disk.

        Further information can be found on the GitHub repository of the
        project.

    Requirements

        In order to run ByteWeiser, the Python 3.x framework must be installed
        on the system.

        There is no official version for Python 2.x, but if you need that for
        whatever reason, you can try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to
        version 2.x using the '3to2' tool:

            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2

        However, there is no guarantee that this works properly or at all.

    Usage

        For fundamental documentation as well as some usage examples for each
        component of the project, you may have a look at the text files inside
        the included 'docs' sub-directory.
