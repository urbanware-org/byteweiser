    Binary files

        In case you want to fiddle around with ByteWeiser in a pure shell
        environment, you can use these binary files, each with two-thirds of
        equal bytes, generated using '/dev/urandom' as follows:

            $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=head bs=40K count=1
            $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=body bs=40K count=1
            $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=foot bs=40K count=1
            $ cat head > file1
            $ cat body >> file1
            $ cat foot >> file1
            $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=body bs=40K count=1
            $ cat head > file2
            $ cat body >> file2
            $ cat foot >> file2

        They are just (useless) files for ByteWeiser testing purposes, only.

    Bitmap files

        There are also two bitmap images with the same content, but one of
        them with a partial grayscale area, to provide visual results after
        processing them with ByteWeiser.
